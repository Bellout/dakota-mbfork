The Dakota GUI has added many significant feature improvements over the last year.  The Dakota GUI now allows you to seamlessly browse Dakota's HDF5 database output files, as well as generate sophisticated graphical plots from HDF5 data with just a few clicks.  HDF5 browsing and plot generation can also be driven within Dakota GUI by Next-Gen Workflow, a powerful tool that allows you to construct node-based workflows for complex tasks.

**Enabling / Accessing:**  Dakota GUI ships with Dakota and is available for Windows, Mac, and RHEL7.

**Documentation:**  An enhanced version of the Dakota GUI manual now ships with the GUI, giving you easy access to a wealth of reference material for using the GUI.
