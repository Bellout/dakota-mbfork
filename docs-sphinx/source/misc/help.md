Help Resources
==============

## Public User Community

Dakota is an open source and publicly available project with a significant worldwide user base. Our vision is that Dakota users will increasingly help each other with questions and issues. We encourage general usage questions about how to use Dakota, including how to install, choose algorithms, or interface to an application code, be posted to our public users' email list. Simply email your question to dakota-users@software.sandia.gov. Your first message will be held for moderation, and after it is approved, you will be subscribed to the list. Please refer to the guidance in our FAQ when preparing your request. Also, note that while we make every attempt to respond to all support inquiries, funding and staffing limitations demand that we prioritize requests as follows:

* Sandia National Laboratories users and integrators
* CRADA and other DOE users and partners, e.g., NNSA/ASC labs, NEAMS and CASL Nuclear Energy initiatives
* Close research or software collaborators
* Other users

## Mailing Lists

Dakota has two public mailing lists. The dakota-announce list provides a mechanism for the development team to distribute announcements to the user community. We send email by this mechanism only a few times per year. The dakota-users list provides a public discussion forum for users. To subscribe to either, simply email your question or request. Your first message will be held for moderation, and after it is approved, you will be subscribed to the list. Alternately, to join without posting, see the subscription management information below.

**Note:** If you submit a general usage question to dakota-users that our development team wants to track to benefit others or the project, the Dakota team may elect to repost the information at a later time to the list, include it in our examples or training, etc. In that case, any personal idenfitying information including name and email address will be removed. 

* **Announce list:** dakota-announce@software.sandia.gov
* **Users list:** dakota-users@software.sandia.gov

When asking a question on dakota-users, please provide the information indicated in our FAQ. Also, we strongly encourage interaction between users. Please feel welcome to respond to questions or concerns raised by others.

The archives of dakota-users and dakota-announce currently are unavailable due to Sandia policy.

## Screencasts

In addition to this manual, the Dakota team has developed [a series of video screencasts](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLouetuxaIMDo-NMFXT-hlHYhOkePLrayY) that are aimed at helping users learn how to use Dakota at varying stages of complexity.  These screencasts complement the material presented in the Dakota GUI manual, since many of the videos use the GUI to demonstrate Dakota usage.
