In addition to this manual, the Dakota team has developed [a series of video screencasts](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLouetuxaIMDo-NMFXT-hlHYhOkePLrayY) that are aimed at helping users learn how to use Dakota at varying stages of complexity.  These screencasts complement the material presented in the Dakota GUI manual, since many of the videos use the GUI to demonstrate Dakota usage.
