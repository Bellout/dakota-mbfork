## [Version 6.11](https://dakota.sandia.gov/content/dakota-611)
### Hot Head Hop (Released November 2019)
The Dakota GUI has added many significant feature improvements over the last year.  The Dakota GUI now allows you to seamlessly browse Dakota's HDF5 database output files, as well as generate sophisticated graphical plots from HDF5 data with just a few clicks.  HDF5 browsing and plot generation can also be driven within Dakota GUI by Next-Gen Workflow, a powerful tool that allows you to construct node-based workflows for complex tasks.

**Enabling / Accessing:**  Dakota GUI ships with Dakota and is available for Windows, Mac, and RHEL7.

**Documentation:**  An enhanced version of the Dakota GUI manual now ships with the GUI, giving you easy access to a wealth of reference material for using the GUI.  

## [Version 6.10](https://dakota.sandia.gov/content/dakota-610)
###Gangplank Galleon (Released May 2019)
The Dakota 6.9 GUI has been updated to work with Dakota 6.10, but not substantially changed. New GUI features will be released with the next Dakota release.

## [Version 6.9](https://dakota.sandia.gov/content/dakota-69)
### Frantic Factory (Released November 2018)
**Highlights:**

* All-new Dakota Study Wizard which guides you through a series of questions to configure a Dakota input file, including choosing an appropriate method.
* Improved simulation inferfacing - Stronger interoperation between wizard-generated Python driver scripts, Next-Gen Workflow drivers, and Dakota studies generated using the New Dakota Study Wizard.
* A variety of Dakota input file text editor enhancements, including completion proposals, alias recognition, more reliable error markers, and formatting options.
* Next-Gen Workflow engine supports graphical plotting nodes.

**Details:**

* New Dakota Study Wizard
 * The wizard supports a host of different data sources for generating Dakota studies.
 * The wizard asks you a series of questions to help you choose a Dakota method.
 * Some chosen methods are pre-populated with heuristic "getting started" settings for your study problem.
 * The wizard has seamless support for both GUI-generated Python scripts and nested workflows as your study's target analysis driver.
* Script-Based Dakota Driver Wizard (formerly Dakota-to-Python Interface Wizard)
 * In addition to a Python driver script, this wizard now generates an "interface manifest" file (see below)
 * Generated Python script can be configured to echo stdout of underlying simulation model, as well as prepend its stdout stream with Dakota run number information.
* Nested Workflow for Dakota Driver Wizard:
 * A new wizard that auto-populates a Next-Gen Workflow file with parameters and responses based on your Dakota study.
* Interface Manifest Support
 * Dakota GUI now accepts arbitrary drivers that define "interface manifest" files - that is, a file that formally states what input and output the driver expects to receive and send.  This interface manifest feature allows files to present themselves as Dakota drivers in multiple contexts, making for easier connection to multiple Dakota studies.
 * Recognized driver formats now include:  Python scripts, SH and CSH scripts, Windows BAT scripts, Next-Gen Workflow files, Perl scripts, VBS scripts.
 * "Recognize as Analysis Driver" context menu option for creating interface manifests for arbitrary files that should be recognized as Dakota drivers.
* Dakota Text Editor
 * Support for Eclipse completion proposals
 * The Dakota text editor now reports errors for duplicate IDs
 * The Dakota text editor now reports that multiple methods without IDs are ambiguous
 * Better error markup for unrecognized keywords and unrecognized parameter list keywords.
 * Text editor now observes both keyword aliases (i.e. alternate keywords according to the Dakota grammar) and partial, non-ambiguous keywords (within reason)
 * Defaults for Dakota text file indentation & quote type are configurable in the Preferences dialog
* Project Navigator View
 * "Add Keyword" context menu option for Dakota input files
* Next-Gen Workflow
 * "Expert mode" flag added to DakotaNode.  Leaving unchecked allows nested workflows to run with fewer nodes.
 * Most Chartreuse plot types supported as Next-Gen Workflow nodes.
 * Changed DakotaNodeâ€™s "search order" for the location of the runtime workflow install directory.
* Chartreuse (aka Integrated plotly.js Plotting)
 * Support for contour plots
 * Plot data providers inform the plotting dialogs about completeness of data
 * The Dakota plot data provider now sets reasonable defaults for simple cases.
* Dakota Console
 * Errors related to launching Dakota from the GUI are now explicitly shown via pop-up dialogs.
* Misc
 * More robust behavior around resolving the path to Dakota at launch time.

**Bugfixes:**

* Script-Based Dakota Driver Wizard:  Feature to auto-substitute new interface block into Dakota input file is no longer broken.
* Dakota Text Editor:  The Dakota text editor now scopes variable duplicate checking to be per-block.
* Dakota Console:  Output and error streams no longer interleave characters together.
* Project Navigator View:  Fixed bug where navigator view of Dakota input file wouldn't always update on a change to the text.

## [Version 6.8](https://dakota.sandia.gov/content/dakota-68)
### Elevator Antics (Released May 2018)
Dakota's graphical user interface (GUI) was substantially updated.

* Dakota input files are fully explorable in the project navigator tree.
* Workspace, project, and file/folder management mechanisms that are standard in the Eclipse framework were adopted.
* Dakota may be run through Eclipse run configurations.
* The analysis driver creation wizard was refactored.
* A preliminary (alpha) version of a new workflow engine has been incorporated. It includes specific nodes for pre-processing and post-processing data files (assists with Dakota interfacing with a simulation model) and for launching Dakota as part of a larger workflow

A number of bugfixes and other enhancements were made as well:

* Added support for built-in Plotly plotting on Linux platforms
* Better default behavior for unlabeled response values, e.g., that were causing correlation matrix parsing to fail
* Squelched "phantom" pop-up dialog behind real dialogs on Linux build
* Bugfix: Mac/Linux version of Dakota GUI appears to truncate Dakota output stream

## [Version 6.7](https://dakota.sandia.gov/content/dakota-67)
### Doorstop Dash (Released November 2017)

* GUI plotting enhancements:
 * Support for log scales
 * Ability to show multiple plot "canvases" together on a grid
 * User-created plots are now top-level Dakota project components
* GUI enhancements/bugfixes:
 * Driver script is automatically created and connected if a Dakota study is created using the wizard and a known simulation model
 * Improved controls for determining Dakota's working directory
 * Improved support in the GUI for shipped Dakota examples
 * Support for renaming Dakota projects
 * Reorganized GUI menu options

## [Version 6.6](https://dakota.sandia.gov/content/dakota-66)
### Coral Capers (Released May 2017)

* Plotly Plotting Integration. The GUI now integrates the Plotly plotting library. You can perform basic scatter plots, histograms, and box-and-whisker plots against Dakota tabular output data.
* Input specification ordering. Reorder and clean up interface, environment, and model blocks to follow more natural ordering and support GUI integration.
* Reordering of Dakota Example Inputs. Several of Dakota's shipped example input files have been reordered to work out-of-the-box in the GUI.
* NIDR Parser Utilities. Developer productivity: NIDR utilities built on all platforms to allow fewer NIDR-generated files in repository and input file reordering in GUI
* Use of examples in GUI. Examples from training, users, and advanced directories are now ordered and debugged to work in GUI
