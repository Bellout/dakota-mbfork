Version 6.17 - Northern Kremisphere (2022/11)
"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""

Version 6.17 is a less dramatic release of Dakota GUI that mainly focuses on bugfixes and incremental
feature improvements. Among the feature improvements is integration with the new Sphinx-based Dakota
help documentation system, as well as improvements to the new MLMF study editor.

*XStream Note:* The official version of XStream has been removed, due to a security vulnerability. ForUsing
the time being, we are using a Sandia-developed fork of XStream in its place for backwards compatibility, but
XStream will eventually stop being used for XML-based object serialization altogether. Stay tuned for more information.

*Deprecation Note:* Links to the old Reference and GUI manuals have been removed; however, the files for the
6.15 reference manual, the 6.16 reference manual, and the GUI's 6.16 manual still reside inside the help plugin for now.
