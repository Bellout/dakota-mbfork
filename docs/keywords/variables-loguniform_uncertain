Aleatory uncertain variable - loguniform
Description::
If the logarithm of an uncertain variable X has a uniform distribution, that is
:math:`\log X \sim U(L_{LU},U_{LU}),` 
then X is distributed with a loguniform distribution. The distribution lower bound is :math:`L_{LU}`  and upper bound is :math:`L_{LU}` 
The loguniform distribution has the density function:

.. math:: f(x) = \frac{1}{ x \left( \ln(U_{LU}) - \ln(L_{LU}) \right) }

Theory::
For some methods, including vector and centered parameter studies, an
initial point is needed for the uncertain variables. When not given
explicitly, these variables are initialized to their means.
