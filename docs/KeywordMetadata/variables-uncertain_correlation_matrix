Correlation among aleatory uncertain variables
Description::
Aleatory uncertain variables may have correlations specified through
use of an ``uncertain_correlation_matrix`` specification. This
specification is generalized in the sense that its specific meaning
depends on the nondeterministic method in use.

When the method is a
nondeterministic sampling method (i.e., :ref:`method-sampling<method-sampling>`), then the
correlation matrix specifies <i>rank correlations</i>
:cite:p:`Iman1982`.

When the method is
a reliability (i.e., ``local_reliability`` or
``global_reliability``) or stochastic expansion (i.e.,
``polynomial_chaos`` or ``stoch_collocation``) method, then the
correlation matrix specifies <i>correlation coefficients</i>
(normalized covariance) :cite:p:`Hal00`.

In either of these cases, specifying the identity matrix results in
uncorrelated uncertain variables (the default). The matrix input
should be symmetric and have all :math:`n^2`  entries where *n* is the
total number of aleatory uncertain variables.

Ordering of the aleatory uncertain variables is:


1. normal

2. lognormal

3. uniform

4. loguniform

5. triangular

6. exponential

7. beta

8. gamma

9. gumbel

10. frechet

11. weibull

12. histogram bin

13. poisson

14. binomial

15. negative binomial

16. geometric

17. hypergeometric

18. histogram point


When additional variable types are activated, they assume uniform
distributions, and the ordering is as listed on :ref:`variables<variables>`.

Examples::
Consider the following random variables, distributions and correlations:

- :math:`X_1` , normal, uncorrelated with others
- :math:`X_2` , normal, correlated with :math:`X_3` , :math:`X_4`  and :math:`X_5` 
- :math:`X_3` , weibull , correlated with :math:`X_5` 
- :math:`X_4` , exponential, correlated with :math:`X_3` , :math:`X_4`  and :math:`X_5` 
- :math:`X_5` , normal, correlated with :math:`X_5`  These correlations are captured by the following commands (order of the variables is respected).
