Blurb:: Multilevel methods for sampling-based UQ

Description:: A nascent sampling method that utilizes both multifidelity and
multilevel relationships within a hierarchical surrogate model in order to
improve convergence behavior in sampling methods.   

In the case of a multilevel relationship, multilevel Monte Carlo
methods are used to compute an optimal sample allocation per level,
and in the case of a multifidelity relationship, control variate Monte
Carlo methods are used to compute an optimal sample allocation per
fidelity.  These two approaches can also be combined, resulting in the
approach below.

<b> Multilevel Control Variate Monte Carlo </b>

If both multifidelity and multilevel structure
are included within the hierarchical model specification, then a control
variate can be applied across fidelities for each level within an
outer multilevel approach.

On each level a control variate is active for the discrepancy \f$Y_{\ell}\f$
based on
\f[ Y_{\ell}^\star = Y_{\ell} + \alpha_\ell \left( \hat{Y}^{\mathrm{LF}}_\ell - \mathbb{E}\left[ Y^{\mathrm{LF}}_\ell \right] \right), \f]
where \f$Y^{\mathrm{LF}}_\ell = \gamma_\ell Q^{\mathrm{LF}}_\ell - Q^{\mathrm{HF}}_\ell\f$.

The optimal parameter \f$\gamma_\ell\f$ is computed from the correlation properties 
between model forms and discretization levels (see the theory manual for further details) 
and the optimal allocation \f$N_\ell\f$ (per level) is finally obtained from it. 

<b> Default Behavior </b> 

The multilevel sampling method employs Monte Carlo sampling be
default, but this default can be overridden to use Latin hypercube
sampling using \c sample_type \c lhs.

<b> Expected Output </b> 

The multilevel sampling method reports estimates of the first four
moments and a summary of the evaluations performed for each model
fidelity and discretization level.  The method does not support any
level mappings (response, probability, reliability, generalized
reliability) at this time.

<b> Expected HDF5 Output </b>

If Dakota was built with HDF5 support and run with the 
\ref environment-results_output-hdf5 keyword, this method
writes the following results to HDF5:

- \ref hdf5_results-sampling_moments (moments only, not confidence intervals)

In addition, the execution group has the attribute \c equiv_hf_evals, which
records the equivalent number of high-fidelity evaluations.

<b> Usage Tips </b>

The multilevel sampling method must be used in combination with a
hierarchical model specification.  When exploiting multiple
discretization levels, it is necessary to identify the variable string
identifier that controls these levels using \c solution_level_control.
Associated relative costs also need to be supplied using \c
solution_level_cost.
