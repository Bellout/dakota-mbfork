Select the usage of surrogate models by adaptive mesh-based search

Description::
There are two approaches available: \c inform_search allows the users
to use a static surrogate which adaptive mesh-based search (NOMAD)
uses to evaluate the neighbors during the extended poll descent.
Essentially NOMAD uses the surrogate to sort list of trial points and
subsequently the true function is evaluated only on the most
promising points. Both true function and surrogate are used
interchangeably via a NOMAD built-in capability. \c optimize forces
NOMAD to use a surrogate in lieu of the true model for both steps and
thus the true function is never invoked.

<b> Default Behavior </b>

By default, NOMAD follows behaviour provided by \c optimize option.

Examples::

The following example shows the syntax used to set \c
use_surrogate.
