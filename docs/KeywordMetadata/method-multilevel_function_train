Blurb:: Multilevel uncertainty quantification using function train expansions

Description::

As described in \ref method-function_train and \ref model-surrogate-global-function_train,
the function train (FT) approximation is a polynomial expansion that exploits low rank
structure within the mapping from input random variables to output quantities of interest
(QoI).  For multilevel and multifidelity function train approximations, we decompose this
expansion into several constituent expansions, one per model form or solution control
level, where independent function train approximations are constructed for the
low-fidelity/coarse resolution model and one or more levels of model discrepancy.

In a three-model case with low-fidelity (LF), medium-fidelity (MF), and
high-fidelity (HF) models and an additive discrepancy approach, we can denote this as:

\f[ Q \approx f_{r_{LF}}^{LF} + f_{r_{\Delta_{ML}}}^{ML} + f_{r_{\Delta_{HM}}}^{HM} \f]

where \f$\Delta_{ij}\f$ represents a discrepancy expansion computed from \f$Q_i - Q_j\f$.

In multilevel approaches, sample allocation for the constituent expansions is
performed as described in \ref method-multilevel_function_train-allocation_control.
