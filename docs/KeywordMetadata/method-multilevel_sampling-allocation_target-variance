method-multilevel_sampling-allocation_target-variance

Blurb:: 
Fit MLMC sample allocation to control the variance of the estimator for the variance.

Description:: 
Computes the variance of the sampling estimator for the variance and fits sample allocation by solving the corresponding optimization problem. This optimization problem is obtained in closed form with an analytical approximation. Additionally, a numerical optimization can be used in that case, see \c optimization.

Examples::
The following method block 
\verbatim
method,
	model_pointer = 'HIERARCH'
        multilevel_sampling
	  pilot_samples = 20 seed = 1237
	  convergence_tolerance = .01
	  allocation_target = variance
\endverbatim

uses the variance as sample allocation target by computing its variance.
