Markov Chain Monte Carlo algorithms from the MUQ package

Description::

The \c muq method supports the following MCMC algorithms: 
adaptive metropolis (AM) or  pure Metropolis Hasting (MH). 

The \c muq method is currently an experimental method that relies 
on algorithms from MIT's MUQ code documented at: 
https://bitbucket.org/mituq/muq2/src/master/

We anticipate using more advanced features of MUQ such as Hamiltonian Monte Carlo 
and Langevin methods in future releases of Dakota.
