Blurb::
(Initial) polynomial order of each univariate function within the functional tensor train.

Description::
This specifies the initial polynomial order of each univariate function that makes up the functional tensor train decomposition.  In future adaptation options (cross-approximation adaptation), polynomial order starts from this value and is then advanced; its maximum value is limited by \c max_order.
