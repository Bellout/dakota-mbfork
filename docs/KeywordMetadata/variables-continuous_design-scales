Characteristic values to scale continuous design variables

Description::
Each real value in \c scales is a nonzero characteristic value to be
used in scaling each continuous design variable They only have effect
when the associated method specifies \c scaling.

This keyword is required for \ref
variables-continuous_design-scale_types of <tt>'value'</tt> and
optional for <tt>'auto'</tt> and <tt>'log'</tt>. When specified in
conjunction with log, scale values are applied prior to the logarithm,
to permit log scaling of strictly negative design variables.

If a single real value is specified it will apply to all continuous
design variables.

Scaling for linear constraints is applied \e after any continuous
variable scaling.

Examples:: Two continuous design variables, both scaled by the characteristic value 4.0
\verbatim
  continuous_design = 2
    initial_point    -1.2      1.0
    lower_bounds     -200      0.001
    upper_bounds      200      2.0
    descriptors       'x1'     "x2"
    scale_types = 'value' 'none'
    scales = 10.0
