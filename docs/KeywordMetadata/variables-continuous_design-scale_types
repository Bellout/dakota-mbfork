How to scale each continuous design variable

Description::
Each string in \c scale_types indicates the scaling type for each
continuous design variable. They only have effect when the associated
method specifies \c scaling.

The options are:

\li <tt>'value'</tt> - characteristic value. If this is chosen, then
    \ref variables-continuous_design-scales must also be specified;
    'value' is assumed if scales are given without \c scale_types

\li <tt>'auto'</tt> - automatic scaling.

\li <tt>'log'</tt> - logarithmic scaling (can be used together with
    \ref variables-continuous_design-scales).

If a single string is specified it will apply to all continuous design
variables.

Examples:: Two continuous design variables, one scaled by a value, the other log scaled,
\verbatim
  continuous_design = 2
    initial_point    -1.2      1.0
    lower_bounds     -2.0      0.001
    upper_bounds      2.0      2.0
    descriptors       'x1'     "x2"
    scale_types =     'value' 'log'
    scales =          4.0      0.1
\endverbatim
