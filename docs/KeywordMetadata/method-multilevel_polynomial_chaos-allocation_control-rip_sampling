Blurb:: Sample allocation based on restricted isometry property (RIP) within multilevel polynomial chaos

Description:: 
Multilevel polynomial chaos with compressed sensing may allocate the
number of samples per level based on the restricted isometry property
(RIP), applied to recovery at level \f$l\f$:

\f[ N_l \geq s_l log^3(s_l) L_l log(C_l) \f]

for sparsity \f$s\f$, cardinality \f$C\f$, and mutual coherence \f$L\f$.
The adaptive algorithm starts from a pilot sample, shapes the profile
based on observed sparsity, and iterates until convergence.  In practice,
RIP sampling levels are quite conservative, and a collocation ratio
constraint (\f$N_l \leq r C_l\f$) must be enforced on the profile.

This capability is EXPERIMENTAL.  Greedy refinement is generally preferred.
