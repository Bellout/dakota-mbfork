Define coefficients of the linear inequality constraints
Description::
In the inequality case, the constraint matrix \f$A\f$ provides 
coefficients for the variables in the two-sided formulation:
\f[a_l \leq Ax \leq a_u\f]

Where the bounds are optionally specified by \c linear_inequality_lower_bounds, 
and \c linear_inequality_upper_bounds.
The bounds, if not specified, will default to -infinity, and 0, respectively,
resulting in one-sided inequalities of the form
\f[Ax \leq 0.0\f].

The linear_constraints topics page (linked above) outlines a few additional
things to consider when using linear constraints.

Topics::	linear_constraints
Examples::

An optimization involving two variables, \c x1 and \c x2, is to be performed. These
variables must satisfy two constraints:

\f[ 1.5 \cdot x1 + 1.0 \cdot x2 \leq 5.0 \f]
\f[ x1 \leq x2 \Longrightarrow x1 - x2 \leq 0.0 \f]

The pair of constraints can be written in matrix form as:

\f[\begin{bmatrix}
  1.5 & 1.0 \\
  1.0 & -1.0 
\end{bmatrix}
  
\begin{bmatrix}
  x1 \\
  x2
\end{bmatrix}
\leq
\begin{bmatrix}
  5.0 \\
  0.0
\end{bmatrix}

\f]

The coefficient matrix and right hand side of this matrix inequality are expressed
to Dakota in the variables section of the input file:

\verbatim

variables
  continuous_design 2
    descriptors 'x1' 'x2'
  linear_inequality_constraint_matrix = 1.5   1.0
                                        1.0  -1.0
  linear_inequality_upper_bounds = 5.0
                                   0.0

\endverbatim
