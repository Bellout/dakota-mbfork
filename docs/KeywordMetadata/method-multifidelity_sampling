Blurb:: Multifidelity sampling methods for UQ

Description:: An adaptive sampling method that utilizes multifidelity
relationships within a hierarchical surrogate model in order to
improve convergence behavior in sampling methods.

In the case of a multifidelity relationship, control variate Monte
Carlo methods are used to compute an optimal sample allocation per
fidelity.

<b> Control Variate Monte Carlo </b>

In the case of two model fidelities (low fidelity denoted as LF and
high fidelity denoted as HF), we employ a control variate approach:

\f[ \hat{Q}_{HF}^{CV} = \hat{Q}_{HF}^{MC}
- \beta (\hat{Q}_{LF}^{MC} - \mathbb{E}[Q_{LF}]) \f]

As opposed to the traditional control variate approach, we do not know
\f$\mathbb{E}[Q_{LF}]\f$ precisely, but rather estimate it more
accurately than \f$\hat{Q}_{LF}^{MC}\f$ based on a sampling increment
applied to the LF model.  This sampling increment is based again on
a total cost minimization procedure that incorporates the relative LF
and HF costs and the observed Pearson correlation coefficient
\f$\rho_{LH}\f$ between \f$Q_{LF}\f$ and \f$Q_{HF}\f$.  The
coefficient \f$\beta\f$ is then determined from the observed LF-HF
covariance and LF variance.

<b> Default Behavior </b> 

The multilevel sampling method employs Monte Carlo sampling be
default, but this default can be overridden to use Latin hypercube
sampling using \c sample_type \c lhs.

<b> Expected Output </b> 

The multilevel sampling method reports estimates of the first four
moments and a summary of the evaluations performed for each model
fidelity and discretization level.  The method does not support any
level mappings (response, probability, reliability, generalized
reliability) at this time.

<b> Expected HDF5 Output </b>

If Dakota was built with HDF5 support and run with the 
\ref environment-results_output-hdf5 keyword, this method
writes the following results to HDF5:

- \ref hdf5_results-sampling_moments (moments only, not confidence intervals)

In addition, the execution group has the attribute \c equiv_hf_evals, which
records the equivalent number of high-fidelity evaluations.

<b> Usage Tips </b>

The multilevel sampling method must be used in combination with a
hierarchical model specification.  When exploiting multiple
discretization levels, it is necessary to identify the variable string
identifier that controls these levels using \c solution_level_control.
Associated relative costs also need to be supplied using \c
solution_level_cost.
