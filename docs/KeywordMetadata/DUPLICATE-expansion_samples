Blurb::
Number of simulation samples used to estimate the expected value of a set of PCE coefficients

Description::
In this case, the expansion order $p$ cannot be inferred from the
numerical integration specification and it is necessary to provide an
\c expansion_order to specify $p$ for a total-order expansion.
