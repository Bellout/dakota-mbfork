Blurb::
UQ method leveraging a functional tensor train surrogate model.
 
Description::
Tensor train decompositions are approximations that exploit low rank structure
in an input-output mapping.  Refer to the \c function_train surrogate model
for additional details.
 
<b> Usage Tips </b>
 
This method is a self-contained method alternative (similar to \c
polynomial_chaos) to the \c function_train surrogate model specification.
