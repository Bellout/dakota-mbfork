Blurb::
UQ method leveraging a functional tensor train surrogate model.
 
Description::
Tensor train decompositions are approximations that exploit low rank structure
in an input-output mapping.  Refer to the \c function_train surrogate model
for additional details.
 
<b> Usage Tips </b>
 
This method is a self-contained method alternative to the
\ref model-surrogate-global-function_train surrogate model specification.
In particular, this method specification directly couples with a simulation
model (optionally identified with a \c model_pointer) and the surrogate
model construction is implicit.
