Define coefficients of the linear equalities
Description::
In the equality case, the constraint matrix \f$A\f$
provides coefficients for the variables on the left hand side of:
\f[Ax = a_t\f]

The linear_constraints topics page (linked above) outlines a few additional
things to consider when using linear constraints.
