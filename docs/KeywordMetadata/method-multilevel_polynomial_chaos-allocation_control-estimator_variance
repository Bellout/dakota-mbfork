Blurb:: Variance of mean estimator within multilevel polynomial chaos

Description:: 
Multilevel Monte Carlo performs optimal resource allocation based on a
known estimator variance for the mean statistic:

\f[ Var[\hat{Q}] = \frac{\sigma^2_Q}{N} \f]

Replacing the simple ensemble average estimator in Monte Carlo with a
polynomial chaos estimator results in a different and unknown
relationship between the estimator variance and the number of samples.
In one approach to multilevel PCE, we can employ a parameterized
estimator variance:

\f[ Var[\hat{Q}] = \frac{\sigma^2_Q}{\gamma N^\kappa} \f]

for free parameters \f$\gamma\f$ and \f$\kappa\f$, with default values
that may be overridden as part of this specification block.

In practice, it can be challenging to estimate a smooth convergence
rate for estimator variance in the presence of abrupt transitions in
the quality of sparse recoveries.  Greedy refinement is generally preferred.
